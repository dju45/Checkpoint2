      <h2>General instructions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Your code have to respect good practices and espacially PSR-1 and PSR-2. <em>N.B.: Codesniffer is
          registered as a dev dependencie in this project.</em></li>
          <li>You have to pushed your code on this project repository. Do it on a branch with your firstname and
            lastname as *Arthur_DUPOND*. Think about atomic commits
          </li>
          <li>All the app is already designed, focus on code, not decoration.</li>
          <li>You work for yourself, if you need help, you can ask to your trainer.</li>

        <h2>1. Algorithm exercise</h2>
        <p>In <samp>src/Service/String.php</samp> you have to write code wich have the same behavior as PHP native
          function <samp>trim()</samp>.
          All your code must be in <samp>trimer()</samp> method.
          In PHP manual, it's describe as it :
          <blockquote cite="http://php.net/manual/fr/function.trim.php">
            <strong>trim</strong> — Supprime les espaces (ou d'autres caractères) en début et fin de chaîne.
            <a href="http://php.net/manual/fr/function.trim.php" target="_blank">see more</a>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            In this checkpoint we only want you to code the basic usage of this function : <strong>removing useless
              white spaces before and after a string.</strong>. So ignore the second optionnal parameter of the native
              trim
              function.
              <!--<em>If you are in a good feeling, you can try to remove other characters which would be given in a second parameter.</em>-->
              When you'll want to test your code, you can run in command lines :
              <code class="block">
                ./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Service/StringToolsTest
              </code>
              If all tests are OK, you can consider your mission acomplished.
              You can commit your work and push it on your remote branch.
              You are not allowed to use regular expressions and off course <em>you to can't use <samp>trim()</samp> function itself and all of trim familly as <samp>rtrim</samp> et <samp>ltrim</samp>.</em>

            <h2>2. Application development</h2>
            Your next mission is to finish the back end part of a Star Wars Wiki. You can read instructions below :
            <ol>
              <li><del>A page which display all characters from data base. All list items display a link to the character's
                details page.</del> <em>Allready done !</em>
              </li>
              <li>A page which displays all details of a specific characters, with all informations about him :
                everything contained in the character table.
              </li>
              <li>The details page also have to display the planet where she/he comes from and in which movies she/he
                can be seen. Those informations are contained in other tables.
              </li>
              <li>A creation page where your can add a new character, and give information about : the planet where
                she/he comes from, movies where she/he can be seen.
              </li>
              <li>On creation page, planets list and movies list are coming from database.</li>
              <li>A page which display all planets from database.</li>
              <li>A creation page where you can add a planet. Off course, when a planet is added in your app, it can
                be selected in character creation page.
              </li>
              <li>A page which display all movies from database.</li>
              <li>A creation page where you can add a movie. Off course, when a movie is added in your app, it can be
                selected in character creation page.
              </li>
              <li>BONUS : If you are already done with that, you can upgrade details page in order to allow users to
                upload images for characters.
              </li>
              <li>BONUS II : You can add any improvement you want on this application.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>If you want to test if all routes are OK, you can try the code below. Your favorite trainer will use this to check if all routes work :
              <code class="block">
                ./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/AppTest.php
              </code>
            </p>
          </div>
